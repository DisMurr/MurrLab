# Contributing to MurrLab

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please open an issue to discuss significant changes before submitting a PR.

## Getting started
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch off `main`.
- Use Python 3.9+.
- Install dev extras locally: install package in editable mode with development optional dependencies.
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably small.

## Guidelines
- Follow existing code style and structure; prefer minimal diffs.
- Add or update tests when public behavior changes.
- Document new features in README or docstrings.
- Use Conventional Commit messages when possible: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`.

## Before submitting
- Ensure imports and basic smoke tests pass locally.
- Run linters and address warnings where feasible.
- Write a clear PR description: motivation, changes, and impact.
